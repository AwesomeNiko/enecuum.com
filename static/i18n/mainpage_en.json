In such a scenario, most visitors will not wait for their orders because it takes too long for the chef to get to them.\n\nIt is therefore more profitable to prepare the meals in parallel. Then many dishes are prepared nearly simultaneously, resulting in a much greater speed of service.\n\nOur HyperDAG technology does exactly that, as it allows the creation of many parallel tasks which are solved by the hundreds of thousands of smartphones that are part of the network. In fact, the greater the number of smartphones exist in the network, the more quickly these parallel tasks are solved. It is thanks to this technology that Enecuum is unique and indeed, a one-of-a-kind blockchain."

Only you can put them back together, because you have a unique key, which tells you how and where to instantly collect and reassemble this 1000-piece puzzle. Even if attackers were able to steal this information from multiple devices, they would not be able to reassemble it and use it without your key.\n\nEach of the pieces is duplicated several times on different devices, so that you can access this photo at any time from anywhere in the world.

          "description": "Smart Contract technology allows you to enter into secure transactions between two or more parties around the world instantly, and without the involvement of expensive lawyers.\nWhy is it called \"smart\"? Until recently, to conclude any deal, you had to draw up a contract, obtain signatures from all interested parties, and then wait several days for payment. All these processes required a lot of time and significant resources. With the introduction of the electronic signature, the process became somewhat faster, but the “red tape” and “human factor” did not disappear.\n\nLet's say you live in Germany and want to buy 10 tons of bananas from Brazil. Previously, you would need to find a supplier, sign a contract with him, purchase bananas, control logistics, and so on. Each stage in the process would be agreed to by a specific agreement the involved parties had to agree to. At the same time, at every stage there is a risk of fraud by any counterparty.\n\nWith an \"intelligent\" contract, everything is much simpler and safer. The system will automatically transfer money throughout the chain at the time of the transaction. It is impossible to deceive the contractor in this situation, since all data is contained in the blockchain and any transaction can be checked if necessary.\nSmart contracts are no longer the province of lawyers, but of good programmers. However, the problem is that the languages for writing smart contracts in different blockchains are at present quite new, and the development community is small. Because of this, the cost of the development of smart contracts is usually very high, and the quality of the code is lower than expected.\n\nEnecuum solved this problem by using a variation of linear logic called SHARNELL to write smart contracts. One of its key feautres is that it simply will not allow the execution of a smart contract that is written with an error. In addition, the main language for creating smart contracts in Enecuum will be the most common programming language in the world - JavaScript, which will not only allow the programmer to develop contracts faster, but also save substantial money on it."
